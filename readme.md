# Sorting Algorithms

This is a project to help me learn introductory algorithms, specifically Insertion, Selection, and Bubble Sort. Resources used were Grokking Algorithms, Lambda School's Training Kit, and limited youtube videos. As much as possible I avoided googling code directly as the goal was to try to transfer a spec to code with as little assistance as possible.

- Open up the [recursive_sorting](src/recursive_sorting) directory
- Read through the descriptions of the `merge_sort` algorithm
- Implement `merge_sort` in [recursive_sorting.py](src/recursive_sorting/recursive_sorting.py)
- Test your implementation by running `test_recursive.py`

## Stretch Goals

- Implement all the methods in the `searching.py` file in the `searching` directory.
- Implement the `count_sort` algorithm in the `iterative_sorting` directory.
- Implement an in-place version of `merge_sort` that does not allocate any additional memory. In other words, the space complexity for this function should be O(1).
- Implement the `timsort` algorithm, which is a real-world sorting algorithm. In fact, it is the sorting algorithm that is used when you run Python's built-in `sort` method.
